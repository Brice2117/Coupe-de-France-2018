# here files about the pince

The pince is simple to use :

-	plug 5V and GND 
-	plug both servo on d√©dicated slot
-	connect the three controles pins to the arduino
-	link in the program
-	use it



I add to the pince a captor for detect when it grab something, the function is autograb()

We dont have already etablish contectic and code for move up and down the pince but we will work on
